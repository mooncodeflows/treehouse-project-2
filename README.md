# Mobile First Responsive Design
In this project, I built a responsive, mobile-first layout using HTML and CSS. The layout demonstrates an understanding of responsive design by adjusting to accommodate small, medium, and large screen sizes.  CSS was written to style the page for a small mobile device first. Then, using min-width media queries, I added breakpoints to adjust the layout for wider tablet and desktop screens.
